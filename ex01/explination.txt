in this ex we take new concepts about how we can use new and delete for alocate the arr of zombie and how we can set echt one of this 
also hw we can delete all zombie live by using delete one time ! 

so look this ! 

we have a class :

class zombie{

    private :
        std::string name;
    publec :
        zombie();
        void annance(void);
        void set_name(std::string name);
        ~zombie();
}

look we add a defult contractor but we dont write anyting insid it so we can remove it cus we take a name of object and set it by set name !!! 
set_name is muber function that help us to access to the name of private artibuate ! 
and ~ zombie is called when we free the our alocation in the heap ! and set inside it the annce that help us  to know if the object is freed !
